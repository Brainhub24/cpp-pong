# C++ Pong

This Pong game in C++ was made with the help of ChatGPT for a YouTube video, which you can watch here: 

To compile and run the game, run:
```console
$ g++ main.cpp -o game -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
$ ./game
```

You need the SFML library to compile the game:
```console
$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

This was the first ever game I have made in C++
